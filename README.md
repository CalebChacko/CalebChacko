I'm Caleb, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo <img src="assets/waterloo_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="15"/>. I'm a machine learning scientist, software developer, and creative problem solver. Lately, I've focused my time and energy on building my capstone project, a mobile app focused on simplifying group cooking by parallelizing multiple recipes into simple steps for each chef. 

I'm currently seeking a new grad position as either a Machine Learning Scientist or Software Engineer. 
My previous experience includes:
- Cloud Developer at [State Street](https://www.statestreet.com/)
- Machine Learning Engineer at [Daily Blends](https://www.dailyblends.com/)
- Data Scientist at [Goldspot Discoveries](https://goldspot.ca/our-technology/)
- Software Developer positions at Bold Commerce, PSI Technologies, and Bell & Howell
